LingoBugs materials, like those for many services to children, are targeted for appeal to parents and caregivers. I worked extensively with the client to create a logo that was fun, safe, and accessible to both kids and adults. We then created a flyer to distribute around nurseries, playgroups and primary schools that would be colourful and exciting to children as well as familiar and inviting to parents.
