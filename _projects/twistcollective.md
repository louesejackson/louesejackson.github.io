Twist collective was a new way to market and distribute knitting patterns online. I had a non-creative role as Technical director. I took creative work from another director and coded up an "online magazine" as well as integrated a joomla! CMS to hold a pattern shop, articles, and errata (technical corrections within a knitting pattern). I also managed art buying and ad placement within the "magazine" and the CMS.
